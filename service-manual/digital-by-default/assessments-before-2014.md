Formal assessments of new and redesigned services against the standard will begin from April 2014. Before then, GDS is using the standard to support the [Cabinet Office controls](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cabinet-office-controls-guidance-version-3-1), deepening knowledge of the standard across government, and identifying areas where we can support departments in building capability.

GDS won't expect any services to fully meet the standard before they receive spending or domain approval from April 2014. Assessments against the standard over 2013 to 2014 will be used to help to highlight areas of improvement for services, and identify systemic problems. 

However, GDS will continue to use the Cabinet Office controls to stop the launch of any new service which:

* doesn’t meet user needs
* can’t be iteratively improved
* contains other clear risks to government or the users.

To request an assessment, please email [gdsapprovals@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto:gdsapprovals@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk?subject="Digital by Default assessment request") with a brief summary of the service.

Service managers should understand he [scope of the standard](/service-manual/digital-by-default/scope-of-the-standard.html). In addition to testing before a service goes live, service managers may wish to request an assessment where you:

* require spend approval to move on to the next phase of a build
* want to go live on a service.gov.uk sub domain
* want to test how the service measures up against the standard before moving on to the next phase of development

Assessments for services will be:

* mandatory for services anticipated to process over 100,000 transactions per year.
* voluntary for services anticipated to process under 100,000 transactions per year.

The assessments will be done by a GDS product manager and technical architect and analyst. All [26 points of the standard](/service-manual/digital-by-default) will be considered but before April 2014 the primary considerations will be:

* does the service meet user needs?
* can it be rapidly improved?
* is it safe, ie are appropriate security and privacy protections in place?
