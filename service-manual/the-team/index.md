The right team needs to be in place to provide a digital by default service. Teams are multidisciplinary, meet regularly, and often work close together to create rapid iterations of user-centred products.

They combine designers, developers, researchers and content specialists to complete a project, and may expand or contract in size as services are developed. The exact shape of the team will vary across departments, and depend on various factors including the number and scale of any transactional services the department is redesigning and running, and the extent to which each will be achieved in house.

## Recruitment

Many of the skills needed to lead and supply digital public services are relatively new to government and are highly sought after.

GDS has pulled together a set of materials to help departments with the [recruitment](/service-manual/the-team/recruitment) of technology leaders and digital specialists.

## Building a digital project team

There's a range of skills and capabilities that need to come together to successfully supply a digital service. The centre is likely to shift as you move through the different phases of development - from discovery, through alphas and betas, preparing for launch, and then running and iteratively improving the live service. The core team is likely to remain fairly constant, but may need to draw in additional resource and expertise along the way.

Regardless of the project approach, all transactional services need to have a [service manager](/service-manual/the-team/service-manager.html).

The service manager is likely to need support from a core team focused on analysing user data, identifying user needs, writing user stories, reporting and other aspects of stakeholder management and governance.

Alongside the service manager at the heart of any digital project team will be the 'makers' - the designers, developers, technical architects and others who design, build, test and deploy the software and content that meet the needs of your users.

Supporting and enabling this 'making' are others who make sure that:

* the user needs are well understood, clearly articulated and prioritised
* stakeholders are kept informed
* releases are well communicated
* users of the service are supported
* performance is monitored 

### The team

A core digital project team needs to be able to:

* analyse [user needs](/service-manual/user-centered-design/user-needs.html), and turn these into [user stories](/service-manual/agile/writing-user-stories.html)
* manage the scope and prioritisation of stories
* manage and report to stakeholders
* manage dependencies on other teams
* where needed, [procure services or solutions from 3rd parties](/service-manual/the-team/working-with-specialists.html)
* design, build, test, demo and iterate software solutions (the 'making'!)
* [test solutions](/service-manual/user-centered-design/introduction-to-user-research.html) on real users
* [deploy and host](/service-manual/operations/hosting.html) the software
* find solutions for [accrediting and handling of data](/service-manual/making-software/information-security.html)
* [supporting the live running of the service](/service-manual/operations/index.html) (monitoring, fixing things when they break, responding to users)

There's no hard and fast rule on the roles or team structure needed to fulfil these functions, but a core team will probably consist of:

* a [service manager](/service-manual/the-team/service-manager.html) (the 'product owner')
	* probably supported by a product manager
	* possibly supported by one or more performance analysts ([job description for this role](/service-manual/the-team/recruitment/performance-analyst-jd.html))
* a [delivery manager](/service-manual/the-team/delivery-manager.html)
* a tech lead
* one or more [designers](/service-manual/the-team/designer.html)
* one or more [user researchers](/service-manual/the-team/user-researcher)
* one or more [developers](/service-manual/the-team/developer.html)
* one or more [content designers](/service-manual/the-team/content-designer.html)
* the support of a [technical architect](/service-manual/the-team/recruitment/Technicalarchitect-generic.docx)
* the support of some [web ops expertise](/service-manual/the-team/web-operations.html)

The team will also have a shared understanding of the [accessibility needs](/service-manual/the-team/accessibility.html) and possible [assisted digital](/service-manual/assisted-digital) needs of a service's users.

### Working with project teams outside of government

If some elements are going to be delivered by third parties (eg software, hosting or operational support) then it will be important to have 'intelligent buyers' in the team. These people will know how to go about [selecting and procuring specialists](/service-manual/the-team/working-with-specialists.html), and what to do to make sure their introduction to the team is as smooth as possible.
